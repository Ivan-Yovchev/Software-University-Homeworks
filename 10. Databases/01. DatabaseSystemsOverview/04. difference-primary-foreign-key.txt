The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each record in the table. It 
can either be a normal attribute that is guaranteed to be unique (such as Social 
Security Number in a table with no more than one record per person) or it can be 
generated by the DBMS (such as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, in Microsoft 
SQL Server). Primary keys may consist of a single attribute or multiple attributes in 
combination.

A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that 
provides a link between data in two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables 
because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link 
between them. The majority of tables in a relational database system adhere to the 
foreign key concept. In complex databases and data warehouses, data in a domain must be 
added across multiple tables, thus maintaining a relationship between them. The concept 
of referential integrity is derived from foreign key theory. Foreign keys and their 
implementation are more complex than primary keys.
