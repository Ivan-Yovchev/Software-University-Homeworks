1. Smaller database: By eliminating duplicate data, you will be able to reduce the overall size of the database.
2. Better performance:
a. Narrow tables: Having more fine-tuned tables allows your tables to have less columns and allows you to fit more records per data page.
b. Fewer indexes per table mean faster maintenance tasks such as index rebuilds.
c. Only join tables that you need.
