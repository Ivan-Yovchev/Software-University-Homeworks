A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) 
that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose 
Research Laboratory. Many popular databases currently in use are based on the 
relational database model. RDBMSs are a common choice for the storage of information in 
new databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, 
personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have 
often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they are 
easier to understand and use. However, relational databases have been challenged by 
object databases, which were introduced in an attempt to address the object-relational 
impedance mismatch in relational databases, and XML databases. Most commercial RDBMS's 
use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database, although SQL was 
invented after the development of the relational model and is not necessary for its 
use. The leading RDBMS products are Oracle, IBM's DB2 and Microsoft's SQL Server. 
Despite repeated challenges by competing technologies, as well as the claim by some 
experts that no current RDBMS has fully implemented relational principles, the majority 
of new corporate databases are still being created and managed with an RDBMS.
