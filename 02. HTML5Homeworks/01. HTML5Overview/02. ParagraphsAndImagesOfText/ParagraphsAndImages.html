    <h1><u>HTML Element</u></h1>

    <p>
        An HTML element is an individual component of an
        HTML document or web page, once this has been parsed
        into the <b>Document Object Model</b>. HTML is composed of
        a tree of HTML elements and other nodes, such as text
        nodes. Each element can have HTML attributes specified.
        Elements can also have content, including other elements
        and text. HTML elements represent semantics, or meaning.
        For example, the title element represents the title of the
        document.

    <h1><i>Syntax</i></h1>

    <p>
        There are multiple kinds of <em>HTML</em> elements: void elements,
        raw text elements, and normal elements.Void elements only
        have a start tag, which contains any <strong>HTML</strong> attributes. They
        may not contain any children, such as text or other elements.
        Often they are place holders for elements which reference external
        files, such as the image element. The attributes included in the
        element will then point to the external file in question.

        This link element points the browser at a style sheet to use
        when presenting the HTML document to the user. Note that in the
        HTML syntax, attributes don't have<br /> to be quoted. When using the
        <sub>XML</sub> syntax (<sup>XHTML</sup>), on the other hand, all attributes must be
        quoted, and a trailing slash is required<pre>b e f o r e  t h e  l a s t  a n g l e</pre>
        bracket.
